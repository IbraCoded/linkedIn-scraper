Financial Analysis
With 12+ years of hands-on experience in the telecommunications
Certifications industry spanning field engineering, regional team leadership, and
Data Sciences for Decision Making data-driven solution design, I bridge the gap between technical
Financial Decision Making expertise and actionable storytelling. My journey began climbing
Technology Operations Management towers as a Radio Network Optimization Engineer, troubleshooting

Global Business Today, I channel that on-ground experience into data analytics to
uncover insights that solve real operator pain points. From radio
networks to business intelligence, I’ve seen how the right solutions
can transform connectivity and user experience.
But I don’t just work in telecoms; I translate it - Telecommunications

under layers of jargon and technical complexity. My mission? - To
break it down.

Future-Focused Curiosity
Whether it’s making sense of networks, and devices, unpacking
industry trends, or exploring the future of communication
technologies, I turn dense topics into clear, engaging, and relatable
content.
I don’t just write about telecoms—I’ve lived it. My articles blend
hard-won field experience with a knack for making LTE standards
or cellular backhaul strategies feel human - I prioritize accessibility
without dumbing down the tech.
